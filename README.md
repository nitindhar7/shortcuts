Shortcuts
=========

A plug-and-play bashrc-like script that can be sourced on linux startup shells. The expectation is to source this in your `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc` or `/etc/bashrc` like so:

    [[ -s /path/to/shortcuts ]] && source /path/to/shortcuts

### Extending

Fork the repo and add more shortcuts. A good use case is to extend the `shortcuts` script by adding internal commands used by your team and having it sourced as part of your dev environment setup!

### Contributing

Send me a pull request if you have useful shortcuts to add and I'll try my best to put them in on time. Make sure you update the README with comments about the shortcut(s) you added
