Shortcuts
=========

A plug-and-play bashrc-like script that can be sourced on linux startup shells. The expectation is to source this in your `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc` or `/etc/bashrc` like so:

    [[ -s /path/to/shortcuts ]] && source /path/to/shortcuts

### Extending

A good use case is to extend the `shortcuts` script by adding internal commands used by your team and having it sourced as part of your dev environment setup!

### Contributing

Fork the repo, add more shortcuts and send me a pull request. I'll try my best to put them in on time. Make sure you update the README with comments about the shortcut(s) you add [below ▼](https://github.com/nitindhar7/shortcuts#list-of-shortcuts)
